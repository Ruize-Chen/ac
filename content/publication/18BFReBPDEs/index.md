abstract: In this study, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs), and dechlorane plus (DPs) were analyzed in seven categories of building and decoration materials. The total concentrations of analyzed FRs ranged from 1.19 ng/g (diatomite powder) to 9532 ng/g (expanded polystyrene panel). Relatively high concentrations were detected in foam samples and PVC materials, followed by sealing materials, boards, wallpaper, paints, and wall decoration powders. BDE209 was the most detected compound with the highest concentrations in almost all materials, followed by decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), which was consistent with their productions and consumptions in China. The estimated PBDE concentrations in air and dust based on material concentration and emission rate were comparable with those detected in real samples. Adult and infant exposures via inhalation and dust ingestion were assessed. The estimated exposures to BDE209 via dust ingestion were 1.36 and 0.12 ng/(kg bw d), which were 19- and 4-fold higher than those via inhalation for infants and adults, respectively. This suggested that dust ingestion was a significant pathway of human BDE209 exposure, especially for infants. For the other PBDE congeners (∑7PBDEs), the estimated exposures via inhalation were 2.60 and 1.32 ng/(kg bw d) for infants and adults, respectively. Despite the low estimated human exposures to PBDEs compared to the oral reference doses, the exposure associated with building and decoration materials still requires more attention because of the potential risks from other exposure pathways and undetected FRs in those materials.
