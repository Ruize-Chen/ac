    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me
Ruize Chen was interested in using statistical approaches and computational simulations, combined with laboratory measurements to understand, reveal, and solve the hazardous environmental issues, like POPs through their source, sink, behaviour, and exposure, or animals through their interactive behaviours. He did care about environmental, ecological, and public health. He was also playing different roles as software engineer, digital twins analyst, and scientific visualization designer, and in the partnership in tech company.
